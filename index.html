        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #151c15; color: aliceblue;" ;>Our Proposal</h2>
        <h2>1.	Introduction: </h2>
        <p>As we know the act Atiya “عطیہ” or Donation” bears significance importance in Islam and our daily life as well. “Charity is for those in need.” is general principle which enjoins us to help people in need, be they good or bad, on the right path or not, Muslims or non-Muslims. When it comes to charitable giving, Pakistan is a generous country. About 98 per cent of people in the country give in one form or another - if not with cash, then with in-kind donations or by volunteering for needy causes. There are numerous charitable organizations operating in Pakistan as well which play a vital role in our society whose welfare services include disaster management, health services, education, orphan care, clean water, Mawakhat (interest-free loan) and other community services for the vulnerable communities of Pakistan.</p><br>
        
        
        <h2>Problem Description:</h2>
        <p>A study conducted by Pakistan Centre for Philanthropy shows that around 98% of Pakistanis give around Rs240 billion (more than $2 billion) annually to charity. Charity organizations play an important role in collecting donations and charities and giving back to the most deserving individuals or to welfare services. In Pakistan no doubt there are charitable organizations; there is a severe lack of trust for these organizations which is hampering their fundraising efforts. Fear of misuse, wastefulness, and lack of impact play an important role in discouraging people from donating to organizations. There is no central space or place where an individual can browse from a huge list of verified and trustable organizations and donate to the charity of his choice or to donate to a deserving individual without worrying about any kind of scam or fraudulent activity. There is also a severe lack of local platforms where an individual can start a fundraiser for his/her problems. As we have noticed, there is lack of these online crowd funding platforms that can be used to support an individual during hard times or even change one’s life; there is a space in the social media that can be filled.</p><br>
         
        <h2>3.	Existing Systems:</h2>
        <p>There are online crowd funding platforms that provide a plenty of welfare services:</p>
        
        <h3>gofundme.com:</h3> 
        <p>GoFundMe is a for-profit crowdfunding platform that allows people to raise money for events ranging from life events such as celebrations and graduations to challenging circumstances like accidents and illnesses.We can organize or donate a fundraiser from supported countries across the globe.</p><br>
         
        
        <h3> Transparent Hands</h3>
        <p> is the largest technology platform for crowdfunding in the healthcare sector of Pakistan. They offer a complete range of free healthcare services including medical and surgical treatments and arranging medical camps for the underprivileged community of Pakistan </p><br>
        
        
        <h3>seedout.org:</h3>
        <p> Seedout help aspiring micro-entrepreneurs access the tools, training, and support they need to lead a more productive life. A single donation can completely transform their lives by providing a means of sustainable income generation. With their innovative micro-financing model and robust micro-funding platform you can make sure your donation, Zakat or Sadqah is delivered to the beneficiaries of your choice. They do not provide hard cash, instead they focus on capacity building and setting up the business. Their motive is to make sure that your donation actually changes their lives for good.</p><br>
        
        
         
        
        
        <h2>4.	Problem not being addressed:</h2>
        <p>All of these web applications are not addressing the problem of not  having central space or place where an individual can browse from a list of trustable organizations and donate to the charity of his choice or to donate to a deserving individual without worrying about any kind of scam or fraudulent activity. All these websites either provide only one kind of welfare service or does not provide to an individual and/or organization. Our proposed solution “Atiya.com” addresses the dire need of an online central platform for charitable purposes. All of the aforementioned websites only cater to the people who wish to donate to any specific kind of charity without doing much research of it beforehand hence there’s a risk of getting fraud or scammed by them. Neither do these websites provide a list of different charities or an individual’s fundraisers that too under specific tags from which a donor can choose from</p><br>
        .
        
        <h2>5.	Problem Solution:</h2>
        <p>The proposed solution as described before is “Atiyat.com”. Atiya “عطیہ” or in English: “Donation/Charity”. This selfless act of giving serves the most vulnerable in society and helps ensure that peoples’ human rights and needs are met. These charities or donations can be given directly to an individual or through charitable organizations. As there are not currently crowdfunding platforms that provide a list of these organizations as well as individuals along with different kinds of welfare services and with full trust, our platform will provide all of these services with the high security and privacy to ensure that no scam or fraudulent activity occurs. To start a fundraiser especially by an individual all of the relevant details regarding their own personal information and their purpose of staring the campaign are collected in detailed form to ensure no fraudulent activity happens. The generous donors will be offered a list of charitable organizations or fundraisers started by individuals as per their desires and will make the donation process very seamless and secure. Our services will support a variety of payment method such as cash, credit or services like Easypaisa, Nayapay or Sadapay to make it feasible for every person. All the financial dealing will occur without any third party interference and/or without any breach of privacy.</p>
